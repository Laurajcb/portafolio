      <p>
      If you were asked me 5 years ago how I imagined myself in 5 years, I probably would say working as a flight attendant, 
      travelling around the world, and sitting in a seat for hours, but after the pandemic the game changed, everybody was looking for a new life,
      I wasn't the exception, that was my opportunity to keep exploring the things and topics I was curios for, so programming was the first thing
      when across my mind, I started with Platzi, And that's when it happened; the spark, the instant I clicked play on my first Python tutorial video.
      Since then. Front-end web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve
      the code (in a separate Git branch, of course). I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens 
      and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.
